# Roadmap

* Language Overview.
* Environemnt Setup.
* Help. Docs. How to run Go programs. Binaries.
* Go program structure
* Variables. Static, dynamic and mixed declaration. Variable error declarion. Defining multiple variables.
  - Task: Define variables of various types at the package level. Print them in the `main` function. In the `main` function create the variable with the same name like any at the package level. Print all variable and investigate the situation.
* Data Types: boolean, numeric, string, derived. Converting between types.
* Constants.
* Operators: arithmetic, relational, logical
  - Task: Complete code which prints results of `x1 / x2 - x3`, `x1 + x2 * x3`, `x1 % x2`, `x1++`
  - Task_01: Complete code demostrating the result type of arithmetic operations on
        a) two variables of the same type (typed)
        b) two variables if only one of them is typed
        C) two untyped variables of different default types
* Pointers vs Values
* Desicion making.
* Loops.
* Functions.
* Strings.
* Arrays.
* Slices.
* Structures.
* Maps.
